        Name of the method
Each method has a name that is used to call it. Generally, it reflects what the method does â€“ prints, finds, calculates, provides you with some information.

The Java compiler requires a method name to be a legal identifier. The rules for legal identifiers are the following:

identifiers are case-sensitive;
an identifier can include Unicode letters, digits, underscore _ or currency characters, such as $;
an identifier can't start with a digit;
identifiers must not be a keyword.
In addition, there is a naming convention that restricts possible method names. It's optional but desired for developers.
By convention, the one-word name should be a verb in lowercase: sum, multiply, or round.

If a method has a multi-word name, the first letter of the second and the following words should be capitalized: getValue, calculateNumberOfOranges, or findLetter.

OK, now we know how the methods are named. Let's talk about how we actually call it!
